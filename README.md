# my-php-framework
Made my own framework. This was a solo project that I made to teah myself about how frameworks work by building one myself.

The website has a router that dyamicly redirects you to the right class and method based on the URL input from a user or clicked link. 
This was build with php, composer, twig, mysql and redbean.
It is a crud application that only alows logged in users to make changes (add, remove and edit) things.

## how to use

1. Make sure you have composer installed on your system.
2. Open up a new terminal in the project folders path and type: "composer install" .
3. Make a database with mysql and call it redbean, in an accout named: bit_academy password: bit_academy.
4. Change the htdocs folder from the localhost (e.g. xamp)  

Thanks for checking out my project!
It was very nice to make, especialy seeing how it went from the first final version to what it is now,
I learned a lot about making the code more dyncamic, shorter and using tailwind to make the front end more appealing.
At the moment I am working on a social media platform using the techniques I learned from this project.

## Preview

If you don't want to install, just check out the code and watch here what it results into.
